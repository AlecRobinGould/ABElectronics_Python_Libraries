Usage
====
To use the IO Zero 32 library in your code you must first import the library:
```
from IOZero32 import IOZero32
```

Next, you must initialise the IOZero32 object with the I2C address of the I/O controller chip.  The default addresses for the IO Zero 32 are 0x20 and 0x21:

```
bus1 = IOZero32(0x20)
```

We will read the inputs 1 to 8 from bus 1 so set port 0 as inputs.  

```
bus1.set_port_direction(0, 0xFF)
```

You can now read pin 1 with:
```
print('Pin 1: ' + str(bus1.read_pin(1)))
```
